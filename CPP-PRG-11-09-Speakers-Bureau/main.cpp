//  Write a program that keeps track of a speaker's bureau. The program should use a
//  structure to store the following data about a speaker:
//
//      Name
//      Telephone Number
//      Speaking Topic
//      Fee Required
//
//  The program should use an array of at least 10 structures. It should let the user enter
//  data into the array, change the contents of any element, and display all the data stored
//  in the array. The program should have a menu-driven user interface.
//
//  Input Validation: When the data for a new speaker is entered, be sure the user enters
//  data for all the fields. No negative amounts should be entered for a speaker's fee.
